# Explanation

Here we have the "Original" code and its "Refactored" equivalent. I wanted to keep a similar implementation 
so we could talk through some alternatives and nice idioms of the language.

## Surface-level changes : 
- Renaming the variables to describe exactly what they represent
- Fixing the spelling of the method
- Adding type hints
- Making the method more resilient by eliminating the variable that could be referenced before assignment (the original function will error on an empty string).

## Structural changes :
First, we'll reverse the incoming_string. While approaches like slicing (`s[::-1]`) might be shorter, 
this spells out fairly plainly that we're reversing something, as well as gives someone footholds 
into the built-ins if they want to read documentation (it's harder to Google [::-1] without knowing 
the term "slice").

While we could simply check to see if the reversed_string equals the incoming_string, I'm purposely avoiding 
that solution per the prompt instructions. Instead, we'll compare the ends of each string and work inward. 
We can take this opportunity to pull out both the index and the character with the `enumerate()` method and 
avoid the overhead of keeping track of what "x" represents after `range()`. If we make it through the middle of the 
string without returning, we know we have a palindrome. This lets us delete the `else` statement altogether.

I might ask the author in a PR review : 
- Can we do this without reversing the incoming string?
- Do we need to consider case sensitivity?
- What should happen if the input is `None`?

# Original

```python
def is_palindrone(s):
    r=""
    for c in s:
        r = c +r
    for x in range(0, len(s)):
        if s[x] == r[x]:
            x = True
        else:
            return False
    return x
```

# Refactored

```python
def is_palindrome(incoming_string: str) -> bool:
    reversed_string = "".join(reversed(incoming_string))

    # Iterate through each index of the incoming_string
    for idx, incoming_character in enumerate(incoming_string):
        if incoming_character != reversed_string[idx]:
            return False

    return True
```
